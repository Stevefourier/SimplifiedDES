# SimplifiedDES
Cryptography - Simplified DES (SDES) using s- boxes

Implementation of encryption and decryption with Simplified DES. The permutations IP, P10, P8, and SW, and the functions fk, F , and the S-box S0 are all as described, and these are hardwired into the  program. A modified S-box S1’ was used. In the modified S1’, the rows 1 and 2 are the same as described for the original S1, but the rows 0 and 3 have been switched. So row 0 is 2, 1, 0, 3 and
row 3 is 0, 1, 2, 3.
